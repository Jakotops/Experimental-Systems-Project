# Experimental-Systems-Project

## Proposal Deliverable (Due 10th November 2023)

The deliverable is a group report, written in teams of 7-9. It must have between 2000 –
3800 words including figure captions – this is a hard limit (appendices are not to be used
to extend this limit etc.). Tables of content, figures, diagrams, and references do not count
towards the word limit. It must use the ACM Primary Article Template which is a single
column format (use Word or LaTeX for editing; submission must be PDF):
https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow

__Structure__: The following structure is mandatory. The report is worth 15% of the of the
overall unit mark and it will be marked according to the criteria below. Every point listed
below must be adequately and concisely covered in the report. The marks listed below
sum up to 100%.


## Background – about 3-4 pages (45%) 
<ul>
  <li>Describe the chosen domain/area (from education, wellbeing, sustainability,
  hobbies, local businesses, and charities – you can select one of these or combine).</li>
  
  <li>Describe a set of challenges/issues that you have identified in the domain/area
  raising both technical and societal issues.</li>
  
  <li>Showcase your motivation for choosing the specific domain/area and
  challenge/issue.</li>
  
  <li>Describe the stakeholders (users and otherwise) that are affected, their context,
  their tasks, as well as their goals.</li>
</ul>

[For the above you would need to show knowledge and understanding of past and
current work in the subject area. This could be by reviewing literature, reviewing
systems that have similar goals, and even having preliminary engagement with
stakeholders in the problem area.]

## Proposed system – about 1-2 pages (15%) 

<ul>
  <li>Propose an idea for a novel interactive system that would address one or more of
  the challenges/issues identified.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Clearly state the aim of the system as a proposed solution.</li>
    <li>Report who may benefit from the proposed system and how.</li>
    <li>Describe potential positive and negative impacts of the proposed system
(considering legal, ethical, and professional implications).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

## Programme and Methodology – about 3-4 pages (including diagram) (40%) 

<ul>
  <li>Describe the steps you would need to take to achieve your project aims (measurable
  objectives against which you would wish the outcome of the work to be assessed).</li>  
  <li>Describe the project management and software development approaches/
  methodologies to be used and justify your choices.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>e.g. programming languages, tools, systems to be used</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Describe the programme of work with enough detail to specify workplans, roles and
  responsibilities for individual team members, how the group will work together, as
  well as the milestones that can be used to measure the project’s progress.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Include a diagram of the project plan (e.g. Gantt Chart or PERT).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Briefly describe potential risks that might arise and your plans to mitigate them.</li>
</ul>

## References – (does not contribute to the word count)
<ul>
  <li>Include a bibliography of the academic papers, articles, websites, and other media
  you used to provide support and rigour in your report.</li>
  
  <li>For citations and references you must use the ACM format:
  https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/reference-formatting</li>
  
Please notice that the ACM citation format is not explicitly covered by the library website
on referencing (see below). If you request the assistance of a librarian, please mention that
you are using the ACM format.
</ul>
