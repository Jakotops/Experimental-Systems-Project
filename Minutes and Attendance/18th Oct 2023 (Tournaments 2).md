Arranging Tournaments Team:

Any evidence for the issue being real?

    Yes there's an app called Tournify which basically addresses the same problem we are trying to solve.
    It has features for managing teams, picking which format we want for our tournament, creating schedules and keeping scores.
    Seems like the problem is already well adressed for sports and esports.

Is it viable for stakeholders?

    Yes because uni sports clubs are always looking to arrange sporting tournaments and meets either recreationally or competitively.

Are there issues surrounding the problem and solution?

    We would need to find a subproblem to address because Tournify already exists.
    The current problem of 'struggling to find tournaments and competitions' is too general would would need to narrow down.

Is there a solution we can develop?

    Yes but we would need to address a subproblem which has not been addressed in other apps such as Tournify

Is the scope realistic?  

    Would currently need to narrow down on the problem first.
    Not overly ambitious as it is a pretty simple idea to understand.
